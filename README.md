### EFTofLSS
This repository collects part of the thesis work carried out to produce and analyse MCMC chains of cosmological parameters' prior/posterior distributions. 
Sampling is achieved with MontePython, with the integration of EFT predictions using the __PyBird__ library. 
The analyses performed on these chains are based on the __GetDist__ and __Tensiometer__ libraries.
